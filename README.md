# ðŸ§  End-to-End Data Science Workflow (Real-World Simulation)

This project showcases a **complete real-world data science pipeline** using simulated datasets. It walks through every major stage of the ML workflow â€” **Data Cleaning**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, and **Model Evaluation** â€” following best practices used by professional data scientists.

Whether you're preparing for interviews or building a solid portfolio, this project will help you understand **how real data is handled**, **insights are generated**, and **models are built and evaluated properly**.
